# Error

---
Generally, three types of errors appear in a computer program
1. **Syntax errors** : 
    * Syntax errors are basically related to the rules of grammar of a certain language.
    * Syntax errors occur whenever the rules laid down by the language are not followed.
      ```python
      print("hi"
      ```
2. **logical errors** :  your code doesn't show any syntax errors, but still the output of the program is not what you anticipate. Such errors are logical errors.
3. **runtime errors** : runtime error also called exception

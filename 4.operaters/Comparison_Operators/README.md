# Comparison operators

---
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

| Operator | Name               | Example |
|----------|--------------------|---------|
| ==       | Equal              | x == y  |
| !=       | Not Equal          | x != y  |
| >        | Greater than       | x > y   |
| <        | Less than          | x < y   |
| >=       | Greater than equal | x >= y  |
| <=       | Less than Equal    | x <= y  |

```python
x = 5
y = 3

print(x == y)
print(x != y)
print(x > y)
print(x < y)
print(x >= y)
print(x <= y)
```
